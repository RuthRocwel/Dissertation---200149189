Urban traffic congestion poses significant challenges, including extended commute times,
environmental pollution, and diminished quality of life. Traditional traffic monitoring 
systems lack real-time data granularity, hindering effective traffic management. 

To address these issues, my project aims to develop a computational intelligence system for real-time
traffic monitoring in smart cities. Leveraging readily available information, machine learning, and 
data analytics, our system will analyse vehicle counts at major traffic points every hour. This 
data will be analysed to generate dynamic traffic patterns, identify congestion hotspots, and forecast 
future traffic trends, enabling proactive traffic management strategies. This benefits the stakeholders 
by enabling efficient traffic management, reducing commute times, and promoting environmental 
sustainability
